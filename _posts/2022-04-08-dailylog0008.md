# Linux USB Install Problem
- Bootable live USB
    1) Live USB - Fast, Read Only, Unable to save any data, resets every time restart
    2) Live USB (Persistence Mode) - Require persistence memory when creating live usb, Slow (Require Fast Read/Write USB Memory stick), Data can be saved.
- Full Installation on USB/SSD
    1) extra bootable USB required
    2) Fast Read/Write USB/SSD required
    3) GRUB can cause some issues (Booting order should change after installation)
    4) Must install GRUB on Memory Stick (USB/SSD)
    5) Memory stick partition should be created
        ```
        Partition 1 (Main) (/dev/sda/)
        Ubuntu Installation Example
        Size = Any (Large Amount)
        Type for the new partition = Primary
        Location for the new partition = Beginning of this space
        Use as = Ext4 journaling file system
        Mount point = /

        Partition 2 (Swap) (Optional but it's for memory)
        Ubuntu Installation Example
        Size = Any (small Amount few Gb)
        Type for the new partition = Logical
        Location for the new partition = Beginning of this space
        Use as = swap area
        ```

            Select disk #
            list volume         (Find FAT32 partition with Hidden)
            Select volume #
            assign letter m     (Any un-assigned letter can be assigned)
            exit
            m:                  (Enter m: folder)
            cd efi
            dir                 (Find Linux folder name)
            rd linux_folder_name /s
            dir                 (Check folder deleted)
            exit                (reboot)
