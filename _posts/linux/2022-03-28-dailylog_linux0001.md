# Linux and Terminal

## Linux
- Linux = "Sort of descendent of Unix"
- Core part of linux system is designed to behave similarly to a Unix System.
- Old shell, text based program can run on both system


## Terminal (Command Line)
- Why Using Command?
    1. it started long time ago whe computer did not have today's power yet.
    2. used to be no graphical mode, only text mode was available
    3. It was designed to run as a multi-user system on mainframe computers, with users connecting to it remotely via individual "terminal"
    4. Today use? its for efficiency
    5. Some machine only allows command line (No Graphical UI)
    6. On Mac = Terminal // On Window = Git Bash (CMD is not Command Line)


## Shell
- shell = User's command
- shell scripts = List of user's command. so when it launches it automatically run all the previously scripted user command.
- very light programming can be done with shell script
- moden shell = bash
