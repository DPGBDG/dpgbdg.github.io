# Basic of Command Line 

Files and Directories

- File - Document that stores information such as text, images, video.  
- Directory - File that stores the names of other files or directories in a hierarchical st.
<br>

Why command line?
- Some machine only allows command line (No Graphical UI)
- Very efficient and faster  
###### On Mac = Terminal // On Window = Git Bash (CMD is not Command Line)
<br>

Command Line Basic Syntax 
<br> 

Format = Command Option File/Name  
(ex: mkdir -p temp)  

- Command line alphabet case rule - Command line is Case-Insensitive.

    echo "Upper case" > A.TXT       New file created, above file deleted
    echo "Mixed case" > A.txt       New file created, above file deleted
    ```

- mkdir - make folder
    ``` 
    mkdir MyFolder

    mkdir -p dir4/dir5/dir6 Create folder inside folder
                            Dir4 > Dir5 > Dir6
                            mkdir -p = Create the parent directories
