# Blog Theme Change & Issues

### Applying Theme to your blog
1. Find theme on Jekyll website (https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme)
   - Easy Way = Use folk (It copy and paste repository to your github)  
                Change Url and use it right away (Some options may restricted)
   - Harder Way = Create Own repository and download theme and apply on my repository
   - Use Free theme on Jekyll
   - some theme does not work
2. Unzip the downloaded theme file and Copy & Paste on your repository
3. Commit to github 
4. Check theme has been applied to my blog

### Posting  
1. Make a new folder name as "_posts"
2. Make a md file
3. File name must follow format
    - yyyy-mm-dd-name.md        (date = Posting date // name = page url)
    ```
    2011-12-31-newyear.md
    ```
4. On the body, insert markdown "front matter" ("Front matter" must be used)  
    Detail on https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/
    - title = Title of the post, else md file name will be used as title by default
    - excerpt = ? 포스트 목록에서 보여지는 블로그 소개 글로 들어간다??
    - categories = Post category (sub url exist)
    - tags = Post tag (No sub url)
    - toc = True/False  // Table of Contents (If you want to use post header list or not)

    - toc_icon = ?
    - toc_label = ?
