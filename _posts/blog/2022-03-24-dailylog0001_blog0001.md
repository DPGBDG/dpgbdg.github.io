# First Day of Blog - Issues and Solutions

- Learn How to create blog on Github
- 404 error page occured

### Creating Blog on Github
1. Create repository on Github (Github > Repository > New)
2. Choose Public/Private 
   - Public - Any one can attempt commit, pull, search (In order to enter blog, it must be public)
   - Private - Only Admin can commit, pull, Unable to search from browser
3. Change repository name from settings
   - name must contain your id+github.io (ex: dpgbdg.github.io)
4. add README.md file  (Markdown file)
5. Clone on my computer   
   (Choose local folder > Github > Repository > Code (Green button) > copy clone url )
6. Start Terminal/Git Bash and enter to local folder you want to clone
   ```
   git clone clone-url
   ```
7. Check README.md file is in your local folder
8. Commit checking
   ```
   echo "Hello World" > index.html
   ```
9. Commiting
   ```
   git add --all        (or git add .)
                        . = current folder,  .. = Parent of current folder) 
   git commit -m "Initial Commit"       (-m = Message)
   git push -u origin main      
            (-u = Connect "main" branch to "origin" remote repository.
            After this commend, user can use simple 
            git pull, git push with out any other commend)
    ```
10. Check all files are commited on Github site > repository
11. Wait 30 ~ 600 seconds (Commit may take some times)
12. Type "dpgbdg.github.io" on browser and check it works
